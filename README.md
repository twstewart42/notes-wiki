Notes on different projects I have worked on 


I have over 3 years of Linux Systems Administration Experience, and this git is a collection of my notes for each technology I have work with and some of the struggles I encountered administering the software. Do not take my notes as gospel, as every situation is different but please use them as an addional piece in whatever puzzle you are trying to solve.
